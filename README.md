This is the first game I ever programmed, way back in 2011. You can tell by its numerous errors, memory leaks, obscure global variables, and nasty hacks - and that's after I removed the bizarre php backend that powered the high scores table (high scores are now saved in localStorage). Best of all, you can play it [here](https://monster-mash.surge.sh)!
